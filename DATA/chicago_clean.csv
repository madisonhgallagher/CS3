Lyrics
"[Verse 1]
You say I'll never change
I'm just a-go around town with some gasoline
Just tryin' to bum a flame
Gonna burn the whole place down
And how do you explain
Ever fallin' in love with a guy like me in the first place
Then turn around, say that I'm the worst thing?
[Chorus]
I guess I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason
[Verse 2]
We try to go our sеparate ways
And we're back and forth likе a swingin' door
And tomorrow's like yesterday
Some days better than the night before
And you're back to me again
Then you go and tell your friends
[Chorus]
That I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason
[Bridge]
If I'm such a waste of breath, such a waste of time
Then why you on your way to waste another Friday night?
[Chorus]
If I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason"

Ooh

Ooh

[Verse 1]
I can feel it
Girl, pick up your phone, I can't believe it
I can feel my spirit slowly leaving
I can't see myself and I'm not breathing (Ah)
I'm not breathing (I'm not breathing)
Slowly bleeding (Bleeding)
I wish that I told you all my feelings
 (Feelings)
I hope that I live life for a reason (Reason)
But at least you'll play this song
When I'm gone
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[Verse 2]
I can't see clear
I wash my fears with whisky tears
I disappear
Don't interfere, the end is near
The crowd'll scream
I block my ears to stop the cheers
'Cause the stage took a toll
Been faded on the floor
In this penthouse prison, I'm alone
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth (Hide the truth)
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[Bridge]
Every time I hit the road, it takes a little piece of me
Kills me slowly (Slowly)
When I needed you the most, you always gave me sympathy
Now you're over me (Over me)
Now you're better on your own, it ain't a fucking mystery
You've been showing me
Now I've been burning up my home, baby
I've been burning up my home
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah"
"I used to think about immature things
You know, like
Do you love me? Do you want me?
Are you gon' call me like you said you would?
Is this really your real phone number?

Some of y'all gon' get washed (washed)
Some of y'all just gon' pop shit
Some of y'all just gon' talk (talk)
But none of y'all ain't really 'bout shit
Some of y'all just look lost (lost, yeah)
I get this type of feeling you ain't accustomed to
I swear I'd be at peace if it weren't for you (yeah, yeah)
Only want your love if it's solid
But if it's fuck me, then fuck you (huh)
And that's the way I like it
That's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
Ain't crackin' a smile for none of these bitches
That's the way I like it
I'm wipin' 'em down in front of they nigga

I'm thirty for thirty, I'm thirty for thirty
I'm thirty for thirty, I'm thirty for thirty, I'm

Chat, should I fold that bitch, no yoga mat?
Chat, should I dead that nigga? Don't hit me back
Chat, should've ran down on you, no questions asked
Chat, chat, they chattin', they chat

When the Sun go down, everything make me feel lonely, yeah
I love side thing, but right now, he's just the homie
Tryna feel good inside, he never no wanna hold me
Hype me up, you get me hyped, you my favorite coach
Come press the line
Fucking stress off, that's my only vice
I take it off when he tell me if I'm feelin' fine
I run it up, risk it all like I'm rolling dice
Takin' it all, it's my second life
That's me (that's me)
Passed out in a nigga backseat (backseat)
Crashed out on a black-sand beach (uh)
Already know my body
Already know that's me
Bitch shit, then you might get minked
Mink, mink, mink
Only want the love if it'ssolid

Everything been otay (otay)
They salute me so damn much, every time I show up, nigga about-face
Everything no cut, I fuck y'all up, I'm really gon' trip 'bout bae (mm-mm)
Blow the '87 guts, why they waitin' on us? Tell 'em I was on PCH
You fuckin' with niggas that's thinkin' they cuter than you, oh
Say you on your cycle, but he on his period too, oh
The tables been turnin' so much, I was thinkin' it's foosball
The tenderness of 'em, mistakin' 'em for some wagyu, oh
Walk, talk like Kenny, like boss
Like Solána, I promise, more buzz, it's a wasp
It's a crater or a spaceship, shut the fuck up, get lost
No favors, I'll wager whatever you worth, I ball
Somethin' about a conservative, regular girl that still can beat a bitch ass
Thorough as fuck, don't need your bitch ass
Psychic as fuck, can read your bitch ass
Zodiac sign, it must be a Gemini Moon 'cause, shit, we about to go half
Mistakenly, nobody been in they bag, but how many bodies done been in her bed?

Some of y'all gon' get washed (washed)
Some of y'all just gon' pop shit
Some of y'all just gon' talk (talk)
But none of y'all ain't really 'bout shit

Chat, do I take his head off and wear it for fashion?
Chat, do I do my stuff and take it to the max?
Chat, they chattin', they chattin', they chat"

Turn it up a little more
[Verse 1: Gabito Ballesteros & 
Tito Double P
]
Seven days have passed, and it weighs on me that you're gone
That you won't come back, and in the end, to hell with it
It's just me and this fucking anxiety
This fucking anxiety
Thirty missed calls and a ""Where are you?""
How am I supposed to explain that I got lost in craziness?
The girls, the homies, to kill this anxiety?
Fucking anxiety
[Chorus: Gabito Ballesteros & 
Tito Double P
]
Tell me what's wrong with you
In the end, you don't even know what you want
To forget you, I made love with others
I don't even mind spending all this cash anymorе, watch out
Tell me what's wrong with you
We sworе love to each other forever
Stop pretending you don't love me
'Cause I can see in your eyes that you still do
Do you get it? Do you get it?
[Interlude: Tito Double P & 
Gabito Ballesteros
]
Hahaha
But do you get it or not?
Tito Double P, ay!
Ayo
That's how your buddy Gabito sounds, man
My little one
On his little motorcycle
Ooh!
[Verse 2: Gabito Ballesteros]
Seven days have passed, and now I accept that you're gone
That I'm gonna forget you and alcohol tastes bad
I already swore for my own good that I won't look at you again
I won't look at you again
[Chorus: Tito Double P & 
Gabito Ballesteros
]
Tell me what's wrong with you
In the end, you don't even know what you want
To forget you, I made love with others
I don't even mind spending all this cash anymore, watch out
Not even you understand yourself
Where did that forever love go?
Stop pretending you don't love me
'Cause I can see in your eyes that you do, understand that, understand that

Psst, I see dead people

Mustard on the beat, ho

[Verse 1]
Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, ""Breathe, bro""
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor

They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
[Verse 2]
You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate,
 
tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie,
 
he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
[Verse 3]
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

Mm
Mm-mm

Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God

Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life

You were as pretty as a blossom
Let's go to Gotham City and show off all of our pretty
Yeah, you were shitty to me after, but I have to admit, I'm guilty
We were so slutty
I was so lucky you were my key
Wherе did our debris go? (Oh, woah)
Gotham City, such a pity we had to get rid of thе pretty
[Verse 2]
Your skin felt like silk (This is just a chitty)
We didn't need no side dick
We was thick like a side chick, yeah
I want us back again, yeah
If you needed a ren, I'd be your tien, yeah
Fuck Adrian, yeah, me and him could only last a circadian
Let the aliens come and get us
I don't want to be a Sapien no more
I just wanna be, ""Anna's Spalpeen"" (Oh, woah)
It can only mean a sad scene
Between me and you, we each other's vaccine
You like my caffeine
I cried over you behind the screen
If you were in a situation, I'd intervene and give a scene
Because I, I love you, make me serene

[Intro]
Pensaba que contigo iba a envejecer
En otra vida, en otro mundo podrá ser
En esta solo queda irme un día
Y solamente verte en el atardecer
Si me ven solo y triste, no me hablen
Si me ven solo y triste, soy culpable
La vida es una fiesta que un día termina
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Eh-eh, eh-eh

I fell asleep in the tub, I was met with paralysis
My foot hit the faucet, water started flowing in
Couldn't scream for help, I just slowly felt the pressure hit
Moving one toe was the only form of motion left
Can't breathe for air, can't breathe
Trying to remember everything that my preacher said
Tryna right my wrongs, my rеgrets filling up my head
All the timеs I dodged death, this can't be the way it ends, no

Figure in the corner I can't quite see (Quite see)

Heartbeat slower, heartbeat slower, heartbeat slower

He estado perdiendo la memoria
No hay otra vida, no hay otro lado
Estoy solo cuando se desvanece en negro

Remember old dude from 2019?
Nice, clean, nigga did me dirtier than laundry (Than laundry)
Took a scroll through his IG
Just to get a DM from his wifey (What the fuck?)

She didn't know about me and I didn't know 'bout Sue
I open up the messages and had to hit the zoom

snort it? Probably would
What can I say? The shit works, it feels good
And my self-worth's at an all-time low

You ain't gotta tell me blow my fire, you know I'm on that, my shit laced
She jumped in my fuckin' ride and said it look like outer space
I just been livin' life P, I took a couple hoes on dates
Me and Smurk keep back to back in Lambos, boy, we tryna race (No bap)
Foenem grave, they gotta free Smurk, he say that shit like every day
Stuffed that lil' bitch like a birdie, she can't sit shit on my face
Hope everybody from the 'Raq make it out, I hope every day
I know this is not a race, but on foenem, I'm in first place
They like, ""Chill, bro, why you cocky?"" But I got told that from the greats (No bap)

I don't fuck with Miami, it's hardly rainin', that's some toxic shit (Toxic shit)
Pour up lean when I feel sick
Don't like Pav, don't fuck with Quagen

Every time these niggas woofin', we hit blocks and leave shit spilled (A mess)

"[Letra de ""NADIE""]
[Verso]
Ya no llames, bebé
Ya no te quiero ver, mucho menos saber el por qué te marchaste
Encontré amores nuevos, mucho más bonitas que la que tenía antes
Por favor, ya no me marques
Evítame la pena de tratarte bien culero como si tú fueras nadie
Ya me enfiesté otra vez
Ya no quiero saber, solo quiero beber para no recordarte
Fueron mil noches enteras, pero estar con otra me hizo recordarte
Como te lo hacía antes
Bajo la luna llena nos estorbó to'a la ropa, hasta la Fendi te quitaste
[Coro]
Las Dom Péri por acá
Mota cherry por allá
¿Qué es lo que quiere, mija?
Lo que quieras te daré
Dos, tres noches sin parar
Otra borrachera más
Por ti el polvo iba a dejar, pero preferiste otro querer
[Post-Coro]
Que según sí te valorara, pero los detalles no mirabas
Todo el amor que yo te daba
Todo lo que empieza también algún día se acaba
Que según sí te valorara, pero los detalles no mirabas
Todo el amor que yo te daba
Todo lo que empieza también algún día se acaba
[Interludio]
Ay, linda
Tito Double P
Lero, lero, lero, como balero, mija
¡Uh!
[Coro]
Las Dom Péri por acá
Mota cherry por allá
¿Qué es lo que quiere, mija?
Lo que quieras te daré
Dos, tres noches sin parar
Otra borrachera más
Por ti el polvo iba a dejar, pero preferiste otro querer
[Post-Coro]
Que según sí te valorara, pero los detalles no mirabas
Todo el amor que yo te daba
Todo lo que empieza también algún día se acaba
Todo algún día se acaba

"[Verse 1]
My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This nine-to-five ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh
[Pre-Chorus]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord
[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniеl's got a history
There's a party downtown near 5th Street
Evеrybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
[Post-Chorus]
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

I've been Boozey since I left
I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma I ain't forget (Oh, Lord), I
Woke up drunk at 10 a.m.​
We gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend, oh, Lord

It's gettin' kind of late, but the ladies want some more

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (Way back)

Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo-ooh)

"[Verse 1]
I know you wanted me to stay
But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in L.A.
 
And I heard that there's a special place
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day
[Refrain]
I'm having wicked dreams of leaving Tennessee
Hear Santa Monica, I swear it's calling me
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream

""God, what have you done?
You're a pink pony girl, and you dance at the club,""

I'm just having fun

[Verse 2]
I'm up and jaws are on the floor
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
Black lights and a mirrored disco ball
Every night's another reason why I left it all
[Refrain]
I thank my wicked dreams, a year from Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica, you've been too good to me
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream
