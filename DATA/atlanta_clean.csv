Lyrics
"[Verse 1]
You say I'll never change
I'm just a-go around town with some gasoline
Just tryin' to bum a flame
Gonna burn the whole place down
And how do you explain
Ever fallin' in love with a guy like me in the first place
Then turn around, say that I'm the worst thing?
[Chorus]
I guess I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason
[Verse 2]
We try to go our sеparate ways
And we're back and forth likе a swingin' door
And tomorrow's like yesterday
Some days better than the night before
And you're back to me again
Then you go and tell your friends
[Chorus]
That I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason
[Bridge]
If I'm such a waste of breath, such a waste of time
Then why you on your way to waste another Friday night?
[Chorus]
If I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason"

We got pounds all on the counter
In the spot, watchin' the cameras
I ain't never scared to take a risk, I know life is a gamble
Can't believe they turned they back on me
Now my life in shambles
I got money, thought they'd be happy for me
They'd rather see me in shackles
Startin' the gas, I can't go backwards
Fifty mill' a year my average
Used to work that kitchen cabinet
Payin' the block, they used laugh at me (Laugh at me)
Yeah, now I'm what they grab at (Yeah)
Back then, they would laugh at me (Yeah)
Now I'm who they grabbin'
My grandma get whatever she want from me 'cause she ain't gettin' no younger
Niggas actin' like they with you, turn your back, they'll put 'em on ya
Feel like the coldest nigga ever, I got permanent pneumonia
There was times I needed help, I had to do it on my own
I ain't cry, it made me strong
Fuck a nigga, I work my phone
They got jammed when we was younger
For fifteen years, D done been gone
I make sure I handle they lawyer fees
Determined to bring 'em home
They was hopin' they'd take me out
But I had made it through the storm
I'm like shoutout to my cousin, dog, he was right there, ain't even have to call (
Uh, I'm a country boy, don't wanna talk for long
)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Had to cut my brother off, I can't believe you broke the law (
Niggas still sip codeine
)
That shit really did somethin' to my head
[Chorus: Rod Wave]
Uh, okay
Got all of this money pilin', Lord, I wanna ball forever
You know I could really use Your help, yeah (Use Your help, yeah)
Thousand on a tractor-trailer, shoutout to my cousin, dog (Yeah)
I couldn't have did it by myself, yeah (Did it by myself, yeah)
Okay, time and time again, I gave you last chances
Love life in the end, at least my pack landed (Yeah)
Thousand on a tractor-trailer, shoutout to my cousin, dog
I couldn't have did it by myself, yeah (Did it by myself)
[Verse 2: Rylo Rodriguez]
Been off the pounds, we built for it, they touchin' the clearport
Lil' broski represented himself
He had beat the feds, he ain't have a lawyer
Soon as we touchin' the airport, we duckin' the task force
Bro said he can't wait 'til he see Alabama like Travis Barker
My opps got security, only 12 I'm rockin' with be Travis Hunter
I had zero, Labaron Philon, now I give allowances to my mama
From the projects to loadin' up a PJ with convicted felons
Since bro snitched on a dead man, he don't think it's tellin'
Can't believe my cousin, dog
Can't believe you took the stand
Can't believe my hood and I
Was a couple niggas, still shook his hand
Wanna make lil' Snoop a highlight tape, thank God he shook the Xans
Had a thousand of 'em on the tractor trailer truck, they sold before they land
Soon as it touch down, hotel trap out of rooms
Shawty want me to pay to get her face beat, Metro Boomin
Postin' weed on your story, you lucky the feds ain't tuned in
Always actin' like you know shit, but you ain't even score shit

Nigga think he runnin' off with mine, good luck
She know she the one, but I barely even call (Yeah)
Fake good bitch, so I treat her like a dog
All fly shit, you won't catch her in the mall
Real dream team, each set huggin' ball
Twenty foreign cars, I ain't never gotta walk
Billion dollar lawyer, I ain't never gotta talk

Am I getting old? Why do I feel tired?
All the same old things, the same old games
Same old pain, think it's time for a change 'cause
Certain shit ain't like me no more
Certain shit don't excite me no more
It don't excite me no more, no
It ain't like me no more
No more, no more
No, no, no, no, no
Certain shit don't excite me no more
It ain't like me no more
This ain't like me no more, no
It don't excite me no more, uh

Hey, how you doing? How's your day going?
You know that you can always say what's on your mind
Are you on your way home?
I'll warm up your plate when you arrive
Hang your coat, take off your shoes, hot water in the tub for you
Don't have to, but I love to do
Bartender, I pour a drink, a movie on to entertain
I'm down to do the little things
[Chorus]
Just wanna take some time to thank ya
And just let you know just how you make me proud
The good times make up for the bad ones
I see you tryin', and I don't know how
You keep up with me when you're workin'
Switch your timin' when our schedules aren't aligning
That's a sign, that's a sign
That it's okay to finally tell the world that you are more than enough, еnough, enough
For me
[Verse 2]
Be right hеre when you're wakin' up
Breakfast on the table, know you like
Eggs and they're all scrambled up
Pancakes, bacon, OJ on the side
Packed your bag with extra clothes, your toothbrush in the Louis tote
Love notes for when you on the road (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cleaned your watch and Cuban links
Silk pillowcase for you to take
Boy, you deserve the little things (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus]
Just wanna take some time to thank ya
And just let you know just how you make me proud
The good times make up for the bad ones
I see you tryin', and I don't know how
You keep up with me when you're workin'
Switch your timin' when our schedules aren't aligning
That's a sign, that's a sign
That it's okay to finally tell the world that you are more than enough, enough, enough
For me
[Refrain]
More than I can say
And you keep givin' me more and more each day
Oh, baby and I never thought I'd end up with
The man of my dreams, you really him
I don't mind takin' time, baby, I'm down to do the little things
More than I can say
And you keep givin' me more and more each day
Oh, baby and I never thought I'd end up with
The man of my dreams, you really him

Life's smoking gun looks dangerous
That's the way it is, that's the way it was
When you learn to run, it was in the mud
It was in the cold, now it's in your blood
I burn from the hell I've seen
But the devil can't hold me down
I've earned all the hell I'll be
Standin' on holy ground
[Verse 1: BigXthaPlug]
Ayy, see the devil keep holdin' me down
But my people say, ""Pop it""
See, I come from the gutter, the mud, the dirt, but somehow, I got tied to this rocket
Huh, I was down on my luck, I ain't had me a buck
Swear this life shit was rocky
Had to figure it out ASAP 'cause see, now I got kids, I be damned if they copy
Every store we walk in, now we shoppin'
If I see it, I like it, I cop it
It was days when I didn't have shit
Used to walk through the store, puttin' shit in my pockets
Kickin' doors, you get caught, keep it solid
All them nights that I felt I was droppin'
All them nights I was thuggin' alone in them streets
If a nigga try me, bet I pop him
Get to thinkin' 'bout shit and get nauseous, shh
All the folks that's six feet in them coffins
All them people that's stuck in them cells, they was havin' that shit, now they can't get it off 'em
All the OGs that used to be bosses
They all dead or in jail, they either was sellin' that shit or was smokin' that shit
Now the youth lookin' crazy as hell (Crazy as hell)

Life's smoking gun looks dangerous

I've earned all the hell I'll be

[Verse 2: BigXthaPlug]
They said if I get me some money that shit would get better and change
The only thing changed 'bout this shit is I got me some money
The rest of this shit still feelin' the same
Shit, it probably got worse
'Cause now I got cake, everybody gon' want them a piece
As soon as you text someone, know they gon' call you a ho 'cause they swear that you owe them a fee
You can't even do for yourself 'cause they peep
They gon' go on the internet, make a lil' post, sayin', ""What about me?""
Shit, what about you? You left me on E
In the jungle, I came out that bitch like a beast
With the lions and tigers, can't fuck with no sheep
Can't compete with a nigga who come from defeat
Huh, pissed 'em off when I got on my feet
Huh, pissed 'em off when I got in my bag
If a nigga hate me, know he mad
How the fuck can you speak out and hate on a nigga who winnin' when you know he worked for that bag?
Swear it's folks who is weird and they sad
But I'm built for it all, that's a fact
But the ones who stayed down and believed in a nigga, I swear we gon' shine even when it get bad, ayy

None of my niggas gon' fold

Get a nigga block, took off

Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet

And I hate it's the truth but, baby, you never do when we're alone together

It was good to see you smile
Girl, you know it's been a while

They say a picture's worth a thousand words
But you ain't said onе since you woke up
Silly me, thinkin' wе could make it work
Can you blame me for getting my hopes up?
You know it took me right back to how it used to be
Baby, seeing us like that is still a little bittersweet

People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""

Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo

Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

You know Lil Ced, that's my nigga, I made him a millionaire, fuck it, we all rich
I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we fuck with the rubber, but I got a raw bitch
Know this money bring envy, you probably wan' be me, but bro, we can't beef 'bout no small shit
Overseas, got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
Businessman, went and got me an office
Million-dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' 
on Sparks Street
Hot lil' jit, he gon' stay with the chopstick
I got robbed, that shit made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sister, my mamas
Now they houses as big as they want 'em
I done ran up them motherfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique
Livin' like we in a race, I might come in first or second, but I won't ever be last
Lately, I been in my bag
Bro told me don't take my foot off the gas
If they give you a inch, go'n and take you a mile
I'ma shoot by myself like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, ""I can't""
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you
, I run with them snakes
Peep all the moves I been makin', by time I get forty, I gotta be one of them greats
Watch how I move with this paper, I know if I slip up one time they gon' try to come take it
Real as it get and these niggas be fakin', I don't want they vibes, so they hand I ain't shakin'
She on that '42 straight with no chaser
I'm tryna get out of here and go taste her, yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, my diamonds be VV's (VV's)
They don't wan' see us on TV unless it's the news
I got somethin' to prove (Somethin' to prove)
Yeah, I'm young, but got somethin' to lose (Somethin' to lose)
In the street, I done paid all my dues (Yeah)
No extortion, ain't talking 'bout literally (Nah)

[Verse 2]
Wake up every day, somebody harrassin' me
I got rich, they need money, they askin' me
I was sittin' in jail, they ain't look out for me
Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me
I been handlin' my own, they can vouch for me
Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be
I done gave her the world, now she not leavin'
Say she love me to death, told her, ""Stop breathin'""
He try do what I do, but we not even
I want all of the beef, I am not vegan
Boy, you said it was smoke, nigga, stop speakin'
'
Ventador, drop the top, I can't stop speedin'
Tryna see if this bitch hit the top speed
Hit the bitch from the back, have her knock knee
Call me Baby Hov, I control the rock
If the rap slow, I control the block
Yeah, I'm really it, and you niggas not
Got a couple coupes, I can drop the top
I done made it, nigga, all these digits comin' in
I'm savin' for the bigger picture, know one day I'll need 'em
Might as well get used to me
My biggest fear is endin' up a used-to-be, yeah

Yeah, my diamonds be VV's (VV's)

I'll do whatever for your love, it ain't no leavin' me

Heard he brought you a bag for a G
Why you fuckin' with them broke niggas?
Gingerale in a fifth of liquor
Where you going girl I'm going with ya
Ride with me 'cause I'm number one
Two bitches might come in the middle
Fly to Vegas, red lights
Legs in the air, call it jet life
Shawty give me top with the neck like
Shit gave me life, I can't get right, can't get right
Got you cruisin' water on a hundred
Got your tempo on a hundred, let it bubble up (bubble up)
Need a bad bitch, tryna be a bad girl
You know I'm tryna trouble up (you know I'm tryna trouble up)
Buy everything she wants two times, baby double up (don't you really want)
Say she need more niggas out here like me
'Cause there's not enough (not enough, not enough, not enough)
She don't know about real niggas
She don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars
She don't what that cost
She don't know about love
She don't know what that is
She don't know about riding round
And spending it like this
Fuck with a nigga like me
Wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me
Wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Hit the club with a nigga like me
Do drugs with a nigga like me
Fall in love with a nigga like me
And never love another nigga
Never love another nigga like
Me me
Me
You ain't never been in my town nigga
A good place to go but the murder rate's so ridiculous
Fell in love with some R&B bitch
And I know that it's good for the fame and for the image
Shawty gave me head like a penny
But she should coco
Ain't really been in love in a minute
It won't hurt if none know about me
For the bad gal, no make up you look better with your mask off
Rich nigga wanna buzz, like to brag y'all
But a nigga like me
Ain't no nigga like me I'm a Boss, Hugo
Rich nigga since birth, you know
You my bitch don't get mad, Cujo
Nigga like me, I'm that nigga, nigga
Gettin' money since a little nigga
Shawty thinks she the shit
But she could be a little thicker
Fuck on my name and a little liquor
I got 'em pissed, I'm the shit nigga
So why do they hate? I gotta get cake
These niggas so fake, so stay out my way
Ain't too many niggas like me
She don't know about real niggas
She don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars
She don't what that cost
She don't know about love
She don't know what that is
She don't know about riding round
And spending it like this
Fuck with a nigga like me
Wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me
Wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Hit the club with a nigga like me
Do drugs with a nigga like me
Fall in love with a nigga like me
And never love another nigga
Never love another nigga like
Me"
