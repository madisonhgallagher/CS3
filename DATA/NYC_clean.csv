Lyrics
"[Letra de ""BAILE INoLVIDABLE""]
[Intro]
Pensaba que contigo iba a envejecer
En otra vida, en otro mundo podrá ser
En esta solo queda irme un día
Y solamente verte en el atardecer
Si me ven solo y triste, no me hablen
Si me ven solo y triste, soy culpable
La vida es una fiesta que un día termina
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Eh-eh, eh-eh
[Interludio: Jacobo Morales]
Mientras uno está vivo
Uno debe amar lo más que pueda
[Coro]
Pensaba que contigo iba a envejecer
En otra vida, en otro mundo podrá ser
En esta solo queda irme un día
Y ver pa'l cielo a ver si te veo caer
Si me ven solo y triste, no me hablen
Si me ven solo y triste, soy culpable
La vida es una fiesta que un día termina
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
[Refrán]
No
, no te puedo olvidar
No
, no te puedo borrar
Tú
 me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
No, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
[Verso 1]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, ey
Dime cómo le hago pa' olvidarte
Hay un paso nuevo que quiero enseñarte
En las noche' ya ni puedo dormir
Lo que hago es soñarte
[Refrán]
No, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
[Verso 2]
Cómo tú me besabas, cómo yo te lo hacía
Cómo tú me mirabas, bellaquito me ponía
Se siente feo no tenerte cerquita
La nueva mama bien, pero no es tu boquita
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita, ey
[Interludio]
'To suena cabrón
Vamo' a hacerlo otra ve'
Como anoche, como anoche
Tan-tan, ta-na-na, ta-na-na
Aprieta, chamaquito, aprieta
¡Ahí, ahí, ahí, vamo' allá!
[Refrán]
No
, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
[Verso 3]
Ay, yo con cualquiera me puedo acostar
Pero no con cualquiera quiero despertar
Solo con usted, con usted
Yo bailo con usted, na' más con usted
Un beso donde estés, donde estés, bebé
[Refrán]
No, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te 
puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
[Verso 4]
Y yo tenía muchas novia'
Pero como tú, ninguna
Ya no tengo mi sol, me paso en la luna
Si te pienso, me tiro de una
Eh-eh, mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita, eh-eh"

Ey, ey, ey, 4 de julio, 4th de July

Con la nota en high por Washington Heights
Willie Colón, me dicen ""еl malo"", ey
Porque pasan los año' y sigo dando palo'
Vendiеndo disco' como cuadro' 'e Frida Kahlo
El perico es blanco, sí, sí, el tusi rosita, eh, eh
No te confunda', no, no, mejor evita, ey (Ey)
Un shot de cañita en casa de Toñita y PR se siente cerquita
Sí, sí, sí, como el campeonato, nadie me lo quita
The best in the world
Number one, the best in the world, ¿okey? ¡Puerto Rico!
¿Cómo Bad Bunny va a ser rey del pop, ey, con reggaetón y dembow?
Ey, con reggaetón y dembow, sí, con reggaetón y dembow
¿Cómo Bad Bunny va a ser rey del pop, ey, con reggaetón y dembow?
Me siento como el Lapiz en ""Capea El Dough""
Cuando yo nací, fue que nació el flow
De la'o a la'o, ping-pong (Pong)
Un flow pesa'o, Big Pun (Pun)
Con silenciador les robamo' las gata', James Bond, ey
Yo estoy en la mía, no tengo adversario, no
Con Los Yankee' y Los Met', Juan Soto
A correr, que otra ve' la sacamo' 'el estadio (Ey)

[Verse 1]
I can feel it
Girl, pick up your phone, I can't believe it
I can feel my spirit slowly leaving
I can't see myself and I'm not breathing (Ah)
I'm not breathing (I'm not breathing)
Slowly bleeding (Bleeding)
I wish that I told you all my feelings
 (Feelings)
I hope that I live life for a reason (Reason)
But at least you'll play this song
When I'm gone
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[Verse 2]
I can't see clear
I wash my fears with whisky tears
I disappear
Don't interfere, the end is near
The crowd'll scream
I block my ears to stop the cheers
'Cause the stage took a toll
Been faded on the floor
In this penthouse prison, I'm alone
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth (Hide the truth)
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[Bridge]
Every time I hit the road, it takes a little piece of me
Kills me slowly (Slowly)
When I needed you the most, you always gave me sympathy
Now you're over me (Over me)
Now you're better on your own, it ain't a fucking mystery
You've been showing me
Now I've been burning up my home, baby
I've been burning up my home
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah"

Otro sunset bonito que veo en San Juan
Disfrutando de todas esas cosas que extrañan los que se van
Disfrutando de noche' de esas que ya no se dan
Que ya no se dan
Pero queriendo volver a la última vez
Que a los ojos te miré
Y contarte las cosas que no te conté (Te parece' a mi crush, jaja)
Y tirarte la' foto' que no te tiré (Acho, jura'o te ves bien linda, déjame tirarte una foto)
Ey, tengo el pecho pela'o, me dio una matá'
El corazón dándome patá'
Dime, baby, ¿dónde tú está'?
Pa' llegarle con RoRo, Julito, Krystal
Roy, Edgar, Seba, Óscar, Darnell y Big Jay, tocando batá
Hoy la calle la dejamo' 'esbaratá
Y sería cabrón que tú me toque' el güiro
Yo veo tu nombre y me salen suspiro'
No sé si son petardo' o si son tiro'
Mi blanquita, perico, mi kilo
Yo estoy en PR, tranquilo, pero

Debí tirar más fotos de cuando te tuve
Debí darte más beso' y abrazo' las vece' que pude
Ey, ojalá que los mío' nunca se muden
Y si hoy me emborracho, pues que me ayuden

Ey, hoy voy a estar con abuelo to'l día, jugando dominó
Si me pregunta si aún pienso en ti, yo le digo que no
Que mi estadía cerquita de ti ya se terminó
Ya se terminó, ey
Que prendan la' máquina', voy pa' Santurce
Aquí todavía se da caña
Chequéate las babie', diablo, mami, qué dulce
Hoy yo quiero beber, beber, beber
Y hablar mierda hasta que me expulsen

Pay the toll to the angels
Drawin' circles in the clouds
Keep your mind on the distance
When the devil turns around
[Refrain]
Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life

Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance, now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night

""Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-oo-ga-ga

I fell asleep in the tub, I was met with paralysis
My foot hit the faucet, water started flowing in
Couldn't scream for help, I just slowly felt the pressure hit
Moving one toe was the only form of motion left
Can't breathe for air, can't breathe
Trying to remember everything that my preacher said
Tryna right my wrongs, my rеgrets filling up my head
All the timеs I dodged death, this can't be the way it ends, no
[Pre-Chorus]
Figure in the corner I can't quite see (Quite see)
I just know the shadow's staring at me
It gets closer, it gets closer, it gets closer now
Figure in the corner laughing at me (At me)
Water fill my lungs, vision blurry
Heartbeat slower, heartbeat slower, heartbeat slower
[Chorus]
Voices'll tell me that I should carry on
Voices'll tell me that I should carry on
Voices'll tell me that I should carry on
Voices'll tell me that I should carry on

I've been baptized in fear, my dear
I've been the chief of sin
Washing my soul within
I've been baptized in fear, my dear
Like Paul, I'm the chief of sin
Washing my soul within, oh

Figure in the corner I can't quite see (Quite see)

Without your love, feelin' suicidal, but I keep my head up
Without the pounds, couldn't count on you, that's why I need my bread up
I told everyone I cut her out, I can't be seen with her
She say I'm a slut, don't give a fuck, I agree with her
Travel 'round the world, and you're the only one that's on my mind
Make me wanna come back home right now, commit a homicide
Treat you like the other side, treat you like you're not my wife
Fuck you like a slut, I can't stop thinkin' 'bout the other night
[Verse 1: Central Cee]
There's truth in the lies
You didn't even seem to care when I blew through a five
I took you shoppin', you was coppin' them shoes in your size
I kept it real with you because I thought you wouldn't mind
Baby, if I knew you'd act like that, I would save you the stress
I don't wanna see you mad like that, but you make me regret
I'm takin' back all what I said, let me pay my respect
Unpress the button, let's restart to the day that we met

Show me love, I know what it was, I gotta reassure (Yeah, yeah)
Tried to geek her up to take some drugs, she like to keep it pure (Oh)
We can't speak on what we did in Vegas, gotta leave it here
Said her titties small, but one surgery make 'em reappear (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm sick and tired of love songs, I flood her out with diamonds
Leave Chanel with hoods on, I like to shop in private
Palm Jumeirah trip, I'm in Dubai, I'm on an island
You get what you want if you just take care of assignments (Oh)
Hold me back, baby, hold me back, baby (Hold me back)
I'm a savage, I'm a 'Raq baby
I'm just goin' to get this money, I'll be back, baby
Put that pussy on me, wonder why I act crazy (Woah, woah, woah)

It's a crater or a spaceship, shut the fuck up, get lost

Somethin' about a conservative, regular girl that still can beat a bitch ass
Thorough as fuck, don't need your bitch ass

Only want your love if it's solid
But if it's fuck me, then fuck you (Huh)
And that's the way I like it
That's the way I like it
That's the way I like it
Ain't crackin' a smile for none of these bitches
That's the way I like it
I'm wipin' 'em down in front of they nigga
That's the way I like it
I'm thirty for thirty, I'm thirty for thirty, I'm thirty for thirty, I'm thirty for thirty, I'm

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
Chat
Should I fold that bitch, no yoga mat?
Chat
Should I dead that nigga, no strings attached?
Chat
Should've ran down on you, no questions asked
Chat, they chattin', they chattin', they chat

[Outro: SZA & Kendrick Lamar]
Chat
Do I let him bump his gums or get him whacked?
Chat
Do I take his head off and wear it for fashion?
Chat
Do I do my stuff and take it to the max?
Chat, they chattin', they chattin', they chat"
"[Verse 1]
Don't know when my nights became so complicated
Can’t recall my mornings ever bein' this faded
Maybe this is karma, definition of jaded, oh
This stays on my mind, this stays on my mind
Tryna put a muzzle on my crazy feelings
One minute I'm cool and then the next, I’m trippin', no
With somebody new, I swear she don't deserve this
Wasted on my mind, she's still on my mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Did we build it up, build it up
Just to let it wash away?
Tell me did I lace you up, lace you up
Just to watch you run away?
[Chorus]
Please tell me who
Who's gettin' all my love? (Love)
Who's gettin' all my love?
Tell me who
Who’s gettin’ all my time?
All of that used to be mine, oh
Who did you teach what I taught ya? (Oh)
Better not give him my nickname
I don't like thinkin’ about it
I swear that it's wearin' me down, no
But tell me who
Who's gettin’ all of my?
Who's gettin' all of my residuals?
[Post-Chorus]
(Who)
Who's gettin' all of my?
Who's gettin' all of my residuals?
(Who)
Who's gettin' all of my?
Who's gettin' all of my residuals?
[Verse 2]
Made it clear you didn't wanna see the sequel
I was lyin' when I said the feeling's mutual, oh
It took some time to realize that we're different people
And love is blind, I see love is blind
[Pre-Chorus]
Did we build it up, build it up
Just to let it wash away?
And tell me did I lace you up, lace you up
Just to watch you run away?
[Chorus]
Please tell me who
Who's gettin' all my love? (Who's gettin'? Love)
Who's gettin' all my love? (My love)
And tell me who
Who's gettin' all my time? (My time, no)
All of that used to be mine, oh (Believe it)
Who did you teach what I taught ya? (Oh)
Better not give him my nickname
I don't like thinkin' about it
I swear that it's wearin' me down, no
But tell me who (So tell me who, yeah)
Who's gettin' all of my? (My)

Mustard on the beat, ho

[Verse 1]
Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, ""Breathe, bro""
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor
[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
[Verse 2]
You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate,
 
tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie,
 
he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
[Verse 3]
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar
[Bridge]
Mm
Mm-mm
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)
He a fan, he a fan, he a
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God

Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life

Wherе did our debris go? (Oh, woah)
Gotham City, such a pity we had to get rid of thе pretty

Your skin felt like silk (This is just a chitty)
We didn't need no side dick
We was thick like a side chick, yeah
I want us back again, yeah
If you needed a ren, I'd be your tien, yeah
Fuck Adrian, yeah, me and him could only last a circadian

"[Intro]
Hey
, I thought it was all over
What's up, Doechii?
Hey, girl
You know it's been a lil' minute since you and I have had a chat
Has it really?
Probably since, like, your last EP, 'Oh the Places You'll Go'
Oh wow, it's been a minute, yeah (
Yeah
)
I've been gettin' some calls
Oh?
People are a little bit worried about you
Not worried, okay
And I know that I was kinda that outlet for you, so
You were
Why don't you just tell me what's been goin' on?
Okay
[Verse 1]
Remember old dude from 2019?
Nice, clean, nigga did me dirtier than laundry (Than laundry)
Took a scroll through his IG
Just to get a DM from his wifey (What the fuck?)
I was so confused, what should Doechii do?
She didn't know about me and I didn't know 'bout Sue
I open up the messages and had to hit the zoom
Turns out the girl was really a dude? (Goddamn)
Nigga think he slicked back 'til I slipped back
Got my lick back, turned a nigga to a knick-knack (To a knick-knack)
I moved on, dropped a couple of songs
And then I went and got signed, now it's 2021
[Interlude]
Okay, I just feel like
This is the perfect opportunity for us to just take a second and kind of unpack what's happened to you
You know, this guy cheated on you, and—
Mm, nah (
Ow
), fuck it
[Verse 2]
""Platinum record"" this, ""viral record"" that (That)
I'm makin' so much money, I'm all over the net
I'm movin' so fast, no time to process
And no, I'm not in a gang, but I'm always on set (Yeah)
Wrist watch, drip drop, label want the TikToks
Now I'm makin' TikTok music, what thee fuck?
I need a cleanse, need a detox
But we ain't got time to stop, the charts need us (And they do)
Fast forward, me, 2023
I'm stackin' lots of cheese and makin' money
My grass is really green, and
[Interlude]
Honestly, 
I can't even fucking cap no more
, this is a really dark time for me
I'm going through a lot
By ""a lot,"" you mean drugs
?
Um, I wouldn't—
Drugs?
No, it's a—
No?
It's a natural plant
No, I'm not judging
I'm not an addict
I'm just saying
I don't think—
You wanna talk about it?
Uh
[Verse 3]
I mean, fuck, I like pills, I like drugs
I like gettin' money, I like strippers, I like to fuck
I like day-drinkin' and day parties and Hollywood
I like doin' Hollywood shit, 
snort it? Probably would
What can I say? The shit works, it feels good
And my self-worth's at an all-time low
And just when it couldn't get worse
My ex crashed my place and destroyed all I owned
Whoopsie, made a oopsie
One-hundred thousand dollar ""oops"" made me loopy
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Don't wanna have to turn a nigga guts into soup beans
[Outro]
Woah! Woah, woah, woah, woah!
 (Rurr)
Okay, Doechii
We don't wanna revert back into our old ways
 (Sorry, okay)
So, we're gonna try a breathing exercise, okay?
 (A'ight, word)
When I breathe, you breathe
 (Okay, okay)
Alright? Let's go
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-ah
Uh, uh, uh, ah

Yo, come on, Mitch, you know I gotta go
Bring your motherfuckin' ass

If it weren’t the UK, would've had a AK-47 with a hundred rounds
Red carpet in my trackie and Air Max, they want a boy with a London style
We ain't got generational wealth, got a couple of mill’ for my unborn child
If I pay a man a hundred thousand pound, I can get man bun right in front of a crowd, uh
That's GBP, the price go up if it's USD
Better watch your words, I'll get you X'd 'bout the shit you tweet (on God)
I told lil' bro if it's personal, he better jump out and do it on feet
We got somethin’ in common with scuba divers, why? ’Cause the guys in deep

If it weren't the UK, would’ve had an AK, gang outside with a samurai sword
Nike Tech fleece with the Air Force 1, my ski mask on, but we don't snowboard
Go on a glide, leave your phone at home, what's wrong with these guys? They go and record
So distraught, we was broke as hell, well, until we broke the law
If I lived in Harlem, I would've been Mitch, them man would’ve been like Ace and snitched
If it was Oakland, I would've been a pimp
If it was 1930, North Carolina, I would've been Frank with the mink
If the opps got nominated for the BRITs, would've went to the ceremony with sticks
And the G-17 would've came with a switch

If it weren't the UK, would've had a AK-47 with a hundred rounds
Red carpet in my trackie and Air Max, they want a boy with a London style
We ain't got generational wealth, got a couple of mill' for my unborn child
If I pay man a hundred thousand pound, I can get man bun right in front of a crowd, uh (pussy)
That's GBP, the price go up if it's USD (21)
Better watch your words, I'll get you X'd 'bout the shit you tweet (on God)
I told lil' bro if it's personal, he better jump out and do it on feet (21)
We got somethin' in common with scuba divers, why? 'Cause the guys in deep

Latex gloves, I'm on the drill, watch 'em fall, Jack and Jill
Up on the opps, seven to nil, Premier League, I'm in the field
Two things that you'll never see is me run from an opp or a bitch in my will
Got day ones, and I'm with 'em still, fightin' demons, swallowin' pills
I still want a deal with Nike (on God)
I can't get caught on no ring, so I'm inside-outtin' the shiesty (straight up)
We go through the front door, 'cause they gon' tell when that back door shit get spicy (rats)
Internet beef, if I catch you in traffic, the fuck you gon' do, nigga, type me? (Pussy)
I put this on God, I hit the bitch once, she already tryna be wifey (damn)
I'm from the street and I got opps, I don't got time to go sightsee (damn)
Wake me up with head, put this in your purse and shut the fuck up if you like me (21)
I'll fill up your closet with birkins, buy you a wagon and make sure you icy (alright)

Alright, If it weren't the UK, would've had an AK-47 with a hundred rounds

"[Intro: Bad Bunny]
What would happen if those nights inside you came back?
It felt so good when I put it in you
You know what we did
And now, without planning, we saw each other in the club
[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro]
What would happen if it were just us?
In a bed, hey, hey, remembering
How I used to give it to you, your friend's already gone
Why are you staying? You're missing something, baby, and
[Post-Chorus: Rauw Alejandro]
I've got it, girl, I've got it, baby
I've got it and I'll give it to you tonight (Wouh)
Her song is playing, her song is playing
You see her, but nobody knows her
Don't think about it anymore, don't think about it anymore
Don't think about it, just give me one more night
And I'll give you what you're missing, baby (Ra-Rauw)
[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro & 
Bad Bunny
]
And if we hook up again, who cares? (Yah!)
This is our business when the urge hits (Wouh)
Our folders are full of videos of us doing it
I've got her bouncing in a split (Yee)
She likes explicit lyrics (Ah!)
You always end up here
My wild girl, and I'm the one who calms you down
I know you won't stop 'til you get what you want (No, oh-oh)
She's fired up, wants me to burn with her (
Wants me to burn with her
)
I'm already thinking of making a couple of kids with you (Ha)
Damn, what a body you have (Woo; 
yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
)
[Verse 2: Bad Bunny & 
Rauw Alejandro
]
Baby, don't act like you don't know what's gonna happen
If I don't pull out, you're gonna have to bottle me up
You know who's got it, I know how you like it
Imagine if we made a baby with our genes, but for now, she doesn't want to
She prefers it in her mouth and took a shot of my DNA
Such a quiet girl, but in bed she never stops (
Yee
)
Sweaty, bouncing, shining like my chains
Da-da-dance, girl (
Yah!
)
She looks at me and grabs it, she knows what it's for
This night is too good
The club is packed, but
[Chorus: Bad Bunny & 
Rauw Alejandro
]
What would happen if it were just us?
In a bed, you and I fucking
Like how I used to give it to you, your friend's already gone
Why are you complaining? You're missing something, eh-eh, eh-eh (
Yah!
)
[Post-Chorus: Bad Bunny & 
Rauw Alejandro
]
I've got it, girl, I've got it, baby
I've got it and I'll give it to you tonight (
Yee!
)
Her song is playing, her song is playing
You see her, but nobody knows her (
Yee!
)
Don't think about it anymore, don't think about it anymore
Don't think about it, just give me one more night
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh, mm

"[Verse 1]
Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go
[Pre-Chorus]
She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
[Chorus]
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
(Mm) Hmm
[Verse 2]
Well, good things don't last (Good things don't last)
And life moves so fast (Life moves so fast)
I'd never ask who was better (I'd never ask who was better)
'Cause she couldn't be (Couldn't)
More different from me (Different)
Happy and free in leather (Happy)
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that you love me (You love me)
You don’t need to remind me (Remind me)
Wanna put it all behind me, but baby
[Chorus]
I see her in the back of my mind (Back of my mind) all the time (All the time)
Feels like a fever (Like a fever), like I’m burning alive (Burning alive), like a sign
Did I cross the line?
[Bridge]
You say no one knows you so well (Oh)
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, cryin’ in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
[Chorus]
And I wonder
Do you see her in the back of your mind in my eyes?
[Outro]
You say no one knows you so well
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel
I know you didn’t mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself"

Grrah, five o'clock with a bop
I'm in her pussy like menstrual (Grrah, grrah)
When I'm strokin', avoid bein' gentle (Let's go)
She a Barbie, but I'm not her Ken though
[Chorus: Jenn Carter & 
Kyle Richh

I'm walkin' on all instrumentals (
Yes

She wanna' go where her friend go (
Yes
)
She wanna' fuck but I'm bustin'
Like, turn up some music and slow down the tempo (
Yes
)
Couple bands just for incidentals (
Yes
)
She keep a rose 'cause she fallin' like petals (
Yes
)
Bitch I'm the one, no, I don't need a medal
Like, big black truck in the hood, presidential (
Like, damn
)
[Verse 5: TaTa]
Bitch, I'm at the mall with the groupies (With the groupies), yeah
We takin' shots at the movies, yeah (At the movies)
If you love her then buy her Chanel, I might go spend a bag up at Louis, yes (Grrah, grrah)
Only think I smoke is 'za, yes (Gas)
Why would I pull out a loosie? Yes (On bro)
Shorty a ten off the wake up, yes
I'm 'bout to buy her a booty, bitch (Buy her a booty)"
