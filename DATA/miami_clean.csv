Lyrics
"[Letra de ""BAILE INoLVIDABLE""]
[Intro]
Pensaba que contigo iba a envejecer
En otra vida, en otro mundo podrá ser
En esta solo queda irme un día
Y solamente verte en el atardecer
Si me ven solo y triste, no me hablen
Si me ven solo y triste, soy culpable
La vida es una fiesta que un día termina
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Eh-eh, eh-eh
[Interludio: Jacobo Morales]
Mientras uno está vivo
Uno debe amar lo más que pueda
[Coro]
Pensaba que contigo iba a envejecer
En otra vida, en otro mundo podrá ser
En esta solo queda irme un día
Y ver pa'l cielo a ver si te veo caer
Si me ven solo y triste, no me hablen
Si me ven solo y triste, soy culpable
La vida es una fiesta que un día termina
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable
[Refrán]
No
, no te puedo olvidar
No
, no te puedo borrar
Tú
 me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
No, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
[Verso 1]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, ey
Dime cómo le hago pa' olvidarte
Hay un paso nuevo que quiero enseñarte
En las noche' ya ni puedo dormir
Lo que hago es soñarte
[Refrán]
No, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
[Verso 2]
Cómo tú me besabas, cómo yo te lo hacía
Cómo tú me mirabas, bellaquito me ponía
Se siente feo no tenerte cerquita
La nueva mama bien, pero no es tu boquita
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita, ey
[Interludio]
'To suena cabrón
Vamo' a hacerlo otra ve'
Como anoche, como anoche
Tan-tan, ta-na-na, ta-na-na
Aprieta, chamaquito, aprieta
¡Ahí, ahí, ahí, vamo' allá!
[Refrán]
No
, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
[Verso 3]
Ay, yo con cualquiera me puedo acostar
Pero no con cualquiera quiero despertar
Solo con usted, con usted
Yo bailo con usted, na' más con usted
Un beso donde estés, donde estés, bebé
[Refrán]
No, no te puedo olvidar
No, no te 
puedo borrar
Tú me enseñaste a querer
Me enseñaste a bailar
[Verso 4]
Y yo tenía muchas novia'
Pero como tú, ninguna
Ya no tengo mi sol, me paso en la luna
Si te pienso, me tiro de una
Eh-eh, mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita
Mi diabla, mi ángel, mi loquita, eh-eh"

[Verso 1]
Otro sunset bonito que veo en San Juan
Disfrutando de todas esas cosas que extrañan los que se van
Disfrutando de noche' de esas que ya no se dan
Que ya no se dan
Pero queriendo volver a la última vez
Que a los ojos te miré
Y contarte las cosas que no te conté (Te parece' a mi crush, jaja)
Y tirarte la' foto' que no te tiré (Acho, jura'o te ves bien linda, déjame tirarte una foto)
Ey, tengo el pecho pela'o, me dio una matá'
El corazón dándome patá'
Dime, baby, ¿dónde tú está'?
Pa' llegarle con RoRo, Julito, Krystal
Roy, Edgar, Seba, Óscar, Darnell y Big Jay, tocando batá
Hoy la calle la dejamo' 'esbaratá
Y sería cabrón que tú me toque' el güiro
Yo veo tu nombre y me salen suspiro'
No sé si son petardo' o si son tiro'
Mi blanquita, perico, mi kilo
Yo estoy en PR, tranquilo, pero
[Estribillo]
Debí tirar más fotos de cuando te tuve
Debí darte más beso' y abrazo' las vece' que pude
Ey, ojalá que los mío' nunca se muden
Y si hoy me emborracho, pues que me ayuden
Debí tirar más foto' de cuando te tuve
Debí darte más beso' y abrazo' las veces que pude
Ojalá que los mío' nunca se muden
Y si hoy me emborracho, pues que me ayuden
[Verso 2]
Ey, hoy voy a estar con abuelo to'l día, jugando dominó
Si me pregunta si aún pienso en ti, yo le digo que no
Que mi estadía cerquita de ti ya se terminó
Ya se terminó, ey
Que prendan la' máquina', voy pa' Santurce
Aquí todavía se da caña
Chequéate las babie', diablo, mami, qué dulce
Hoy yo quiero beber, beber, beber
Y hablar mierda hasta que me expulsen
'Toy bien loco (
'Toy bien loco
), 'toy bien loco (
'Toy bien loco

Cabrón, guía tú, que hasta caminando yo estoy que choco
'Toy bien loco (
'Toy bien loco
), 'toy bien loco (
'Toy bien loco

Vamo' a disfrutar, que nunca se sabe si nos queda poco
Debí tirar más f—

Gente, lo' quiero con cojone', los amo
Gracias por estar aquí, de verdad
Para mí e' bien importante que estén aquí
Cada uno de ustede' significa mucho para mí
Así que, vamo' pa' la foto, vengan pa'cá
Métase to'l mundo, to'l corillo, vamo'
Zumba
[Verso 3]
Ya Bernie tiene el nene y Jan la nena'
Ya no estamo' pa' la movie' y las cadena'
'Tamos pa' las cosa' que valgan la pena
Ey, pa'l perreo, la salsa, la bomba y la plena
Chequéate la mía cómo es que suena
[Outro]
Debí tirar más fotos de cuando te tuve
Debí darte más besos y abrazo' las veces que pude
Ojalá que los mío' nunca se muden
Y que tú me envíe' más nude'
Y si hoy me emborracho, que Beno me ayude"
"[Letra de ""VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR""]

Acho, PR es otra cosa
Yo la conocí en Miami, en Brickell
Ella sabe que aquí hay ticket
Quiere que yo se la aplique
Que pa' casa la trafique
[Coro]
Vo'a llevarte pa' PR, mami, pa' que vea' cómo es que se perrea

Y estoy suelto, mami, estoy suelto
Mírame ahora, perreando un experto
Estoy suelto, mami, estoy suelto, ey, ey, ey
Hoy la calle está prendida, hookah, pastilla molida

¿Dónde están las mala'? Que son bienvenida'
'Toy puesto pa'l lío, dime si tú lía'
Tus amiga' y to' el corillo 'tán bien rica', pero ese culo tuyo, wow, sobresalía
Salimo' de la disco y estaba de día
Obviamente salí con la que quería, ey

Aquí nací yo y el reggaetón, pa' que sepa'
Ey, ey, ey

[Verse 1]
I can feel it
Girl, pick up your phone, I can't believe it
I can feel my spirit slowly leaving
I can't see myself and I'm not breathing (Ah)
I'm not breathing (I'm not breathing)
Slowly bleeding (Bleeding)
I wish that I told you all my feelings
 (Feelings)
I hope that I live life for a reason (Reason)
But at least you'll play this song
When I'm gone
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[Verse 2]
I can't see clear
I wash my fears with whisky tears
I disappear
Don't interfere, the end is near
The crowd'll scream
I block my ears to stop the cheers
'Cause the stage took a toll
Been faded on the floor
In this penthouse prison, I'm alone
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth (Hide the truth)
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[Bridge]
Every time I hit the road, it takes a little piece of me
Kills me slowly (Slowly)
When I needed you the most, you always gave me sympathy
Now you're over me (Over me)
Now you're better on your own, it ain't a fucking mystery
You've been showing me
Now I've been burning up my home, baby
I've been burning up my home
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah"
"[Verse 1]
You say I'll never change
I'm just a-go around town with some gasoline
Just tryin' to bum a flame
Gonna burn the whole place down
And how do you explain
Ever fallin' in love with a guy like me in the first place
Then turn around, say that I'm the worst thing?
[Chorus]
I guess I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason
[Verse 2]
We try to go our sеparate ways
And we're back and forth likе a swingin' door
And tomorrow's like yesterday
Some days better than the night before
And you're back to me again
Then you go and tell your friends
[Chorus]
That I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason
[Bridge]
If I'm such a waste of breath, such a waste of time
Then why you on your way to waste another Friday night?
[Chorus]
If I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason"

Yo, this is the Carbon Fiber Music version
Me compré un full
Carbon, bebé
Me compré un full
***Bad man ting, Bumbaclat***
¡Pu-Pu-Pu-Pu!
Me compré un full (Fu-fu-full)
Me compré un full (Yo, ¡pi-ri-pi-pi-ri-pi-pi-ri-pi, po!)
[Verso 1: Farruko]
Fusile' de alto calibre', tácticos, con extensión
Glock nueve milimetro' de la quinta generación
Cargadore' repleto', ya no e' bala', hay mucho money, zoom
Un Phillie prendí'o, 512, y mucho Oxycodone
Y no es que estoy en guerra, es que me cuido de la envidia
Pa' que ningún cabrón venga a joder con mi familia
La cargo, chambeo, la saco, la agarro, apunto y oprimo el botón, -ón
No reaccionaste, no te diste cuenta, flaqueaste y te prendí el carbón, -ón
¿A quién tú va' a meter en un baúl?
¿A quién tú va' a ponerle un manto azul?
¿A quién?, hmm, pa' ti tengo una full
Hazte hombre primero, conmigo ni tu socio ni tú
¿¡A quién!?
[Verso 2: Alexio ""La Bestia""]
A mí el que se me embiste le' vamo' a romper to' lo' apellido'
Si el cáncer no me mató, ustede' ni solo' ni unido'
Me compro un fulete pa' romperte afuera 'e Mama Juana
Te vamo' a dejar la cabeza plana
Que lluevan lo' problema', aunque los jefes a mí sin cojone'
Tengo un cepillo 'e treinta lleno de solucione'
Me gusta la paz, pero te juro delante' 'e Dios
Que si hay guerra no arreglamos hasta que se caigan to'
Ustede' cambiando de bichote y nosotro' de peine'
No asomen la cabeza pa' que no se despeinen

(Oye, compositor más famoso urbano)
[Verso 3: Benny Benni]
Me compré un full que se escucha bien bonito
Con un botonazo del planeta te emancipo (Prrr)
Antes que compo, 'toy cargando to' el equipo
Flow Bayamón, como batata, phillie y tripo
Se acaba el juego, por el cristal me pego
Hasta lo' cachete' botan fuego
Como Sinfónico en lo' beat' de malianteo (Ya tú sabe')
No habrá cantante que supere este chanteo
""La Jodienda"", hijo de puta, ""El Más Que Escribe""
Tengo putas, tengo haters, como Kobe y Justin Bieber
La combi es Gucci, el pikete bien Ñengoso
Me compré un full, do' minus tre', ocho' mojoso'
Tengo una moña como el pelo de Lary
En la que Gangalee porque lo saco de safari
Tengo una cubana que pesa más que Alexio
Almighty no es el loco, loco e' Benny el de Nemesio

Me compré un fulete pa' volarte lo' seso' y lo' dreads
Volvió el carnicero a comer gente como en Walkin' Dead
El Guasón, bebé, eh, cuando lo' pillé, yeh
Hago que pidan perdón y se arrodillen, -llen
¿No ves cómo to's lloran?, rápido pillan, so corre
Despué' no estén dando queja', no llamen pa' Torre'
Prende el palo coja, que ese sonido mejore
Esto' cabrone' se cayeron de la lista, yo los borré
Me importa un carajo quien esté contigo (Contigo)
Me importa un carajo qué pase contigo (Contigo)
Por mí todos se pueden morir (Morir, morir)
Me compré un full que los va a partir, yeh (¡Prra!)
[Verso 5: Menor Menor]
Papi, me compré un full, para desaparecer
Cuando en la calle me miran y no sé qué van a hacer
Este metal tiene poder 
(Me co— me co-, me co— me co— me— me—)
El plomo los alcanzara antes que comiencen a correr
Ni el forence los va a reconocer
No me detendrán ni volviendo a nacer

Se esconden, y yo los busco con las herramientas

I fell asleep in the tub, I was met with paralysis
My foot hit the faucet, water started flowing in
Couldn't scream for help, I just slowly felt the pressure hit
Moving one toe was the only form of motion left
Can't breathe for air, can't breathe

[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro]
What would happen if it were just us?
In a bed, hey, hey, remembering
How I used to give it to you, your friend's already gone
Why are you staying? You're missing something, baby, and
[Post-Chorus: Rauw Alejandro]
I've got it, girl, I've got it, baby
I've got it and I'll give it to you tonight (Wouh)
Her song is playing, her song is playing
You see her, but nobody knows her
Don't think about it anymore, don't think about it anymore
Don't think about it, just give me one more night
And I'll give you what you're missing, baby (Ra-Rauw)
[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro & 
Bad Bunny
]
And if we hook up again, who cares? (Yah!)
This is our business when the urge hits (Wouh)
Our folders are full of videos of us doing it
I've got her bouncing in a split (Yee)
She likes explicit lyrics (Ah!)
You always end up here
My wild girl, and I'm the one who calms you down
I know you won't stop 'til you get what you want (No, oh-oh)
She's fired up, wants me to burn with her (
Wants me to burn with her

I'm already thinking of making a couple of kids with you (Ha)
Damn, what a body you have (Woo; 
yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verse 2: Bad Bunny & 
Rauw Alejandro
]
Baby, don't act like you don't know what's gonna happen
If I don't pull out, you're gonna have to bottle me up
You know who's got it, I know how you like it
Imagine if we made a baby with our genes, but for now, she doesn't want to
She prefers it in her mouth and took a shot of my DNA
Such a quiet girl, but in bed she never stops (
Yee
)
Sweaty, bouncing, shining like my chains
Da-da-dance, girl (
Yah!
)
She looks at me and grabs it, she knows what it's for
This night is too good
The club is packed, but
[Chorus: Bad Bunny & 
Rauw Alejandro

What would happen if it were just us?
In a bed, you and I fucking
Like how I used to give it to you, your friend's already gone
Why are you complaining? You're missing something, eh-eh, eh-eh (
Yah!

Tit for tat, I got you back, was I wrong for that shit?
Tell me, is we too grown for that shit? Uh
I wanna lock it in, baby, no weighin' my options
Wanna travel, see the world, gettin' drunk on an island
Wanna settle, start a family, so tell me about it
And you so perfect, baby, don't give nobody that body (Okay)
Social anxiety, I fear
And I done been this way for some years
I don't really get along with my peers
Everything that they do to me is weird
So in a world full of weirdos, fools, and scrubs
Tell me, what is it you're willin' to do for love?
You know it's true that the datin' pool is fucked
Ain't nobody out here, baby, it just be us
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know a broken heart when I see one
And I feel, and I feel, and I feel, and I feel like I love you more
Did you know? Do you know? Did you know? Do you know I'm a shoulder if you need one?
When I feel what I feel, keep it real, what’s the deal? I'm ready for
Go somewhere we could be alone, you and me alone
I remember bein' twenty-one when my life had just begun
Twenty-two, many things to see and do
Twenty-three, lookin' forward to twenty-four
Is it just me or it ain't no love no more?
Twenty-five, what a time to be alive
Am I getting old? Why do I feel tired?
All the same old things, the same old games
Same old pain, think it's time for a change 'cause
Certain shit ain't like me no more
Certain shit don't excite me no more
It don't excite me no more, no
It ain't like me no more
No more, no more
No, no, no, no, no
Certain shit don't excite me no more
It ain't like me no more

Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him

Rumors goin' all over town
Can't keep my name out they mouth these days

Truth is I just ain't about these games

Wanna find
Somethin' stronger than the whiskey
And oh, I've tried
But every time I feel her kiss me, I keep comin' up empty, yeah

I just wanna love somebody
Who won't leave a hole in my heart
I just wanna love somebody
That don't want me fallin' apart
And I'd be lucky if I ever find
A somethin' more than just a crazy night
I just wanna love somе-
[Verse 2]
​-Body who ain't hypnotized
By dollar signs and blindin' lights
Like they tеnd to be, yeah
I need someone that I'd be proud
To take on back to my hometown
Honest eyes that just ain't gonna lead
[Pre-Chorus]
To lonely nights
Even when she's up against me
I don't know why
It feels like there's nobody with me
And I'm still empty, yeah

I just wanna love somebody
Who won't leave a hole in my heart
I just wanna love somebody
That don't want me fallin' apart

You got a lotta nerve, don't you, baby?
I only hit the curb 'cause you made me
You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy

Why'd you throw them stones if you
Had a wild hair of your own or two?
Livin' in your big glass house with a view
I thought you knew
[Chorus: Post Malone]
I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf

You think that you're so innocent
After all the shit you did
I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
Can't wash our hands of this

"I'm tryna spit that real shit every time
Just tryna keep it all the way up
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh
Bahamas light work
Turks might work, might work
I told her, ""You would love to party, "" yeah (turn me up, Fivee)
She say, ""I'm just getting started, "" damn
Mm-mm, pretty girls, pretty girls, pretty girls
Turn into bad bitches
Look, look
Ain't no more holdin' her hand, it's time to expand
She wanna get on the 'Gram and take pics in the sand
She tryna work on her tan, you ever been to Thailand?
We ain't gotta pack no clothes, we can shop when we land
You want bad bitch views? What you willin' to do?
She can't come to your room, unless it's in Tulum
You ain't ready for her, I think you should slow your roll
Is you ready for her? No, no, no, no, no (no, no, no)
She's a passport junkie, spend that bread like a dummy
Yeah, he met her on Sunday, was in the airport by Monday
If you really gettin' money, take that girl out the country
She like niggas that's fun, takin' shots, gettin' blunted
I'll do whatever for your love, it ain't no leavin' me
Spend a million in a month, who gon' compete with me?
I might take her to Paris, fly out her whole family
He rented a yacht and took her to Miami
Listen, listen, listen, I love Miami
But she don't wanna go no more
She don't wanna go no more
'Cause it's not the same
Times changed
Oh, how the times change
She don't wanna go no more
She don't wanna go no more
She's a passport junkie
Takin' trips out the country
Takin' trips out the country
Oh, how the times change
'Cause it's not the same
Oh, how the times change (aye, listen)
She don't wanna go no more
If you ain't got no bag, you can't even bag her
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
She don't wanna go no more (oh, youngin)
I'll never forget it, man, 200 dollar hotel rooms and shit
Used to be the shit (not the same), no sir
Oh, how the times change

If you ain't got no paper, man, focus on yourself, man

"[Verse 1]
Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know
[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
[Verse 2]
Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh
[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me (Mm-hmm)
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah

[Chorus]
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm

Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me"

No sé pa' qué seguir disimulando más (No)

Vo'a presumir que estás dura (Oh), yo tu gángster, tú mi chula
Contigo me pasa que no me importa lo que comenten
Si nos llegan a la altura (No, no), tienes vibra de alma pura (OH)
Para el mal, ella es mi cura, su cintura está demente
[Puente]
Yo me enamoré, eh, eh, eh, eh
De ti más me enamoro, oh, oh, oh, oh (Ah-ah)
Con la espalda en la pared, eh, eh, eh, eh (Eo)
Sin pensar que alguien nos vio, oh, oh, oh, oh
De ti yo me enamoré, eh, eh, eh, eh (Aye)
De ti más me enamoro, oh, oh, oh, oh

Introduce 'em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire
Fah-fah, fah-fah-fah, fah-fah, fah
Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it's hot
If this world was mine, I'd take your dreams and make 'em multiply
If this world was mine, I'd take your enemies in front of God
Introduce 'em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire
It's a vibe, do your dance, let 'em watch
She a fan, he a flop, they just wanna kumbaya, nah
In this world, concrete flowers grow
Heartache, she only doin' what she know
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure (if this world were)
If it was up to me
I wouldn't give these nobodies no sympathy
I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything
I just wanna see you win, wanna see (if this world were mine)
It go in (when you), out (ride it), do it real slow (slide)
Baby, you a star, strike, pose (right)
When I'm (when you), with you (with me), everything goes (slow)
Come and (put that), put that (on my), on my (titi), soul (soul)
'Rari (red), crown (stack), wrist (stay), froze (really)
Drip (tell me), pound (if you), on the way home (love me)
In this world, concrete flowers grow
Heartache, she only doin' what she know
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure (if this world were)
If it was up to me
I wouldn't give these nobodies no sympathy
I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything
I just wanna see you win, wanna see (if this world were mine)
I can't lie, I trust you, I love you, I won't waste your time
I turn it off just so I can turn you on
I'ma make you say it loud
I'm not even trippin', I won't stress you out
I might even settle down for you, I'ma show you I'm a pro
I'ma take my take my time and turn it off
Just so I can turn you on, baby
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure
I know you'll come
I know you're comin' for
(Anything)
(If this world were mine)"
"[Intro: Rauw Alejandro]
I wrote down my feelings, then erased them
Told you I didn't love you, and I ruined it
But I knew, when you walked away, all I longed for was to kiss you
I remember leaving your house that night
Saying ""no,"" though I meant ""yes""
But I sensed your doubt, and it pulled me in
That's why we're here now
[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro]
You ask me, ""Why?"" and I say, ""Why not?""
If we're nothing, then what are we doing here?
What are we playing at? Time's slipping away
And without me, I wonder if you're truly okay
You ask me, ""Why?"" and I say, ""Why lie?""
Deep down, we both know it's clear to see
It's eating you up
To say you're better off without me
[Verse 2: Romeo Santos]
I tried to act tough but it fell apart
You tried to be my friend, and I kissed you
You know the truth
We can't control what we feel inside
I call others just to try to forget
But in my mind, it's you on repeat
More than a fleeting fire, baby, you disguise it
That's why we're here
[Chorus: Romeo Santos]
You ask me, ""Why?"" and I say, ""Why not?""
If we're nothing, then what are we doing here?
What are we playing at? Time's slipping away
And without me, I wonder if you're truly okay
You ask me, ""Why?"" and I say, ""Why lie?""
Deep down, we both know it's clear to see
It's eating you up
To say you're better off without me
[Verse 3: Romeo Santos & 
Rauw Alejandro
]
Rauw
What's the name of this game we're caught in, both of us?
With the masks we wear, the truth is hidden from view
You knew all along
I loved you more than I let on
I say ""Let me go,"" but inside I'm aching
When I'm lost
I reach for you, but stay silent
[Bridge: Rauw Alejandro]
Stay
Where are you going? Come, don't leave me now
Baby, stay
Where are you running off to?
[Chorus: Romeo Santos]
You ask me, ""Why?"" and I say, ""Why not?""
Deep down, we both know it's clear to see
It's eating you up
To say you're better off without me
[Interlude: Rauw Alejandro, 
Romeo Santos
]
You ask me, ""Why?""
And I say, ""Why not?,"" and I say, ""Why not?""
You ask me, ""Why?""
And without me, I wonder if you're truly okay
Baby
It's Rauw Alejandro with The King Romeo, haha (
The biggest
)
Baby, I don't know what it is that we are, just know it's special
[Outro: Rauw Alejandro]
I wrote down my feelings, then erased them
Told you I didn't love you, and I ruined it
But I knew
(When you walked away, all I longed for was to kiss you)"
