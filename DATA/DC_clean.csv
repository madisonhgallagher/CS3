Lyrics
"[Intro]
Ooh
, yeah
Ooh
, 
yeah
[Verse 1]
I can feel it
Girl, pick up your phone, I can't believe it
I can feel my spirit slowly leaving
I can't see myself and I'm not breathing (Ah)
I'm not breathing (I'm not breathing)
Slowly bleeding (Bleeding)
I wish that I told you all my feelings
 (Feelings)
I hope that I live life for a reason (Reason)
But at least you'll play this song
When I'm gone
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[Verse 2]
I can't see clear
I wash my fears with whisky tears
I disappear
Don't interfere, the end is near
The crowd'll scream
I block my ears to stop the cheers
'Cause the stage took a toll
Been faded on the floor
In this penthouse prison, I'm alone
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth (Hide the truth)
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[Bridge]
Every time I hit the road, it takes a little piece of me
Kills me slowly (Slowly)
When I needed you the most, you always gave me sympathy
Now you're over me (Over me)
Now you're better on your own, it ain't a fucking mystery
You've been showing me
Now I've been burning up my home, baby
I've been burning up my home
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah"
"I used to think about immature things
You know, like
Do you love me? Do you want me?
Are you gon' call me like you said you would?
Is this really your real phone number?

Some of y'all gon' get washed (washed)
Some of y'all just gon' pop shit
Some of y'all just gon' talk (talk)
But none of y'all ain't really 'bout shit
Some of y'all just look lost (lost, yeah)
I get this type of feeling you ain't accustomed to
I swear I'd be at peace if it weren't for you (yeah, yeah)
Only want your love if it's solid
But if it's fuck me, then fuck you (huh)
And that's the way I like it
That's the way I like it
And that's the way I like it
Ain't crackin' a smile for none of these bitches
That's the way I like it
I'm wipin' 'em down in front of they nigga
That's the way I like it
I'm thirty for thirty, I'm thirty for thirty
I'm thirty for thirty, I'm thirty for thirty, I'm

Chat, should I fold that bitch, no yoga mat?
Chat, should I dead that nigga? Don't hit me back
Chat, should've ran down on you, no questions asked
Chat, chat, they chattin', they chat

When the Sun go down, everything make me feel lonely, yeah
I love side thing, but right now, he's just the homie
Tryna feel good inside, he never no wanna hold me
Hype me up, you get me hyped, you my favorite coach
Come press the line
Fucking stress off, that's my only vice
I take it off when he tell me if I'm feelin' fine
I run it up, risk it all like I'm rolling dice
Takin' it all, it's my second life
That's me (that's me)
Passed out in a nigga backseat (backseat)
Crashed out on a black-sand beach (uh)
Already know my body
Already know that's me
Bitch shit, then you might get minked
Mink, mink, mink
Only want the love if it'ssolid

Some of y'all gon' get washed (washed)
Some of y'all just gon' pop shit
Some of y'all just gon' talk (talk)
But none of y'all ain't really 'bout shit
Some of y'all just look lost (uh, uh)
I get this type of feeling you ain't accustomed to
I swear I'd be at peace if it weren't for you (yeah, yeah)
Only want your love if it's solid
But if it's fuck me, then fuck you (huh)
And that's the way I like it

Everything been otay (otay)
They salute me so damn much, every time I show up, nigga about-face
Everything no cut, I fuck y'all up, I'm really gon' trip 'bout bae (mm-mm)
Blow the '87 guts, why they waitin' on us? Tell 'em I was on PCH
You fuckin' with niggas that's thinkin' they cuter than you, oh
Say you on your cycle, but he on his period too, oh
The tables been turnin' so much, I was thinkin' it's foosball
The tenderness of 'em, mistakin' 'em for some wagyu, oh
Walk, talk like Kenny, like boss
Like Solána, I promise, more buzz, it's a wasp
It's a crater or a spaceship, shut the fuck up, get lost
No favors, I'll wager whatever you worth, I ball
Somethin' about a conservative, regular girl that still can beat a bitch ass
Thorough as fuck, don't need your bitch ass
Psychic as fuck, can read your bitch ass
Zodiac sign, it must be a Gemini Moon 'cause, shit, we about to go half
Mistakenly, nobody been in they bag, but how many bodies done been in her bed?

Some of y'all gon' get washed (washed)
Some of y'all just gon' pop shit
Some of y'all just gon' talk (talk)
But none of y'all ain't really 'bout shit
Some of y'all just look lost (uh, yeah)
I get this type of feeling you ain't accustomed to
I swear I'd be at peace if it weren't for you (yeah, yeah)
Only want your love if it's solid
But if it's fuck me, then fuck you (huh)
And that's the way I like it
That's the way I like it
That's the way I like it
Ain't crackin' a smile for none of these bitches
That's the way I like it
I'm wipin' 'em down in front of they nigga
That's the way I like it
I'm thirty for thirty, I'm thirty for thirty
I'm thirty for thirty, I'm thirty for thirty, I'm

Chat, should I fold that bitch, no yoga mat?
Chat, should I dead that nigga, no strings attached?
Chat, should've ran down on you, no questions asked
Chat, they chattin', they chattin', they chat

Chat, do I let him bump his gums or get him whacked?
Chat, do I take his head off and wear it for fashion?
Chat, do I do my stuff and take it to the max?
Chat, they chattin', they chattin', they chat"
"[Intro]
Psst, I see dead people
(
Mustard on the beat, ho
)
[Verse 1]
Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, ""Breathe, bro""
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor
[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
[Verse 2]
You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate,
 
tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie,
 
he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
[Verse 3]
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar
[Bridge]
Mm
Mm-mm
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)
He a fan, he a fan, he a
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Let me hear you say, ""OV-ho"" (
OV-ho
)
Say, ""OV-ho"" (
OV-ho
)
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way
[Outro]
Are you my friend?
Are we locked in?
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way"

Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it's hot
If this world was mine, I'd take your dreams and make 'em multiply

"[Verse 1]
You say I'll never change
I'm just a-go around town with some gasoline
Just tryin' to bum a flame
Gonna burn the whole place down
And how do you explain
Ever fallin' in love with a guy like me in the first place
Then turn around, say that I'm the worst thing?
[Chorus]
I guess I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason
[Verse 2]
We try to go our sеparate ways
And we're back and forth likе a swingin' door
And tomorrow's like yesterday
Some days better than the night before
And you're back to me again
Then you go and tell your friends
[Chorus]
That I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful
Then why'd you stick around this long?
And if it's the whiskey
Then why you keep on pullin' it off the shelf?
You hate that when you look at me, you halfway see yourself
And it got me thinkin'
If I'm the problem, well, you might be the reason

If I'm such a waste of breath, such a waste of time
Then why you on your way to waste another Friday night?

If I'm the problem
And you're Ms. ""Never Do No Wrong""
If I'm so awful

I fell asleep in the tub, I was met with paralysis
My foot hit the faucet, water started flowing in
Couldn't scream for help, I just slowly felt the pressure hit
Moving one toe was the only form of motion left
Can't breathe for air, can't breathe
Trying to remember everything that my preacher said
Tryna right my wrongs, my rеgrets filling up my head
All the timеs I dodged death, this can't be the way it ends, no

Figure in the corner I can't quite see (Quite see)

Heartbeat slower, heartbeat slower, heartbeat slower

Pensaba que contigo iba a envejecer
En otra vida, en otro mundo podrá ser
En esta solo queda irme un día
Y solamente verte en el atardecer
Si me ven solo y triste, no me hablen
Si me ven solo y triste, soy culpable
La vida es una fiesta que un día termina
Y fuiste tú mi baile inolvidable

Todo lo que tengo es mi legado
He estado perdiendo la memoria
No hay otra vida, no hay otro lado
Estoy solo cuando se desvanece en negro
Se desvanece en negro
No hay otra vida, no hay otro lado
Estoy solo cuando se desvanece
Juega, sonríe, vive plenamente
Cuando la vida es dura
Sé que la muerte es fácil
Woah

El sol nunca sale
No sé si es de día o de noche (O de noche)
Y no puedo encontrar el horizonte (Horizonte)

Nice, clean, nigga did me dirtier than laundry (Than laundry)
Took a scroll through his IG
Just to get a DM from his wifey (What the fuck?)
I was so confused, what should Doechii do?
She didn't know about me and I didn't know 'bout Sue
I open up the messages and had to hit the zoom
Turns out the girl was really a dude? (Goddamn)
Nigga think he slicked back 'til I slipped back
Got my lick back, turned a nigga to a knick-knack (To a knick-knack)
I moved on, dropped a couple of songs
And then I went and got signed, now it's 2021
[Interlude]
Okay, I just feel like
This is the perfect opportunity for us to just take a second and kind of unpack what's happened to you
You know, this guy cheated on you, and—
Mm, nah (
Ow
), fuck it
[Verse 2]
""Platinum record"" this, ""viral record"" that (That)
I'm makin' so much money, I'm all over the net
I'm movin' so fast, no time to process
And no, I'm not in a gang, but I'm always on set (Yeah)
Wrist watch, drip drop, label want the TikToks
Now I'm makin' TikTok music, what thee fuck?
I need a cleanse, need a detox
But we ain't got time to stop, the charts need us (And they do)
Fast forward, me, 2023
I'm stackin' lots of cheese and makin' money
My grass is really green, and
[Interlude]
Honestly, 
I can't even fucking cap no more
, this is a really dark time for me
I'm going through a lot
By ""a lot,"" you mean drugs
?
Um, I wouldn't—
Drugs?
No, it's a—
No?
It's a natural plant
No, I'm not judging
I'm not an addict
I'm just saying
I don't think—
You wanna talk about it?
Uh
[Verse 3]
I mean, fuck, I like pills, I like drugs
I like gettin' money, I like strippers, I like to fuck
I like day-drinkin' and day parties and Hollywood
I like doin' Hollywood shit, 
snort it? Probably would
What can I say? The shit works, it feels good
And my self-worth's at an all-time low
And just when it couldn't get worse
My ex crashed my place and destroyed all I owned
Whoopsie, made a oopsie
One-hundred thousand dollar ""oops"" made me loopy
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Don't wanna have to turn a nigga guts into soup beans
[Outro]
Woah! Woah, woah, woah, woah!
 (Rurr)
Okay, Doechii
We don't wanna revert back into our old ways
 (Sorry, okay)
So, we're gonna try a breathing exercise, okay?
 (A'ight, word)
When I breathe, you breathe
 (Okay, okay)
Alright? Let's go

Thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, thunk, baby rockin' it
Quid pro quo, what you want? 'Cause I'm watchin' it
Work on the floor, let me know if you clockin' it
Brodie won't go, but I know that he poppin' it
It was woof tickets on sale 'til I silenced it
Pipe down, young, these some whole other politics
Bitch with him and some bitch in him, that's a lot of bitch
Don't hit him, he got kids with him, my apologies
Ghetto child, it was Blacky Milds with the Smirnoff
Yeehaw, we outside, whoadie 'bout to kill him off
Blaps on blaps, it's a fact, this a brick of raw
Tell me why the fuck you niggas rap if it's fictional?
Tell me why the fuck you niggas fed if you criminal?
""Ayy, Dot, can I get a drop?"" I'm like, ""Nigga, nah""
Ace boon coon from the Westside to Senegal
It's a full moon, let the wolves out, I been a dog

I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but she don't got no taste

Every night's another reason why I left it all

I could go and read your mind
Think about your dumb face all the time
Living in your glass house, I'm outside, uh
Looking into big blue eyes
Did it just to hurt me, make me cry
Smiling through it all, yeah, that's my life
[Pre-Chorus]
You're an idiot, now I'm sure
Now I'm positive, I should go and warn her
[Chorus]
Ooh, bet you're thinking, ""She's so cool""
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
[Verse 2]
What'd she do to get you off? (Uh-huh)
Taking down her hair like, oh my God
Taking off your shirt, I did that once
Or twice, uh
No, I know, I know I'll fuck off (Uh-huh)
But I think I like her, she's so fun
Wait, I think I hate her, I'm not that evolved
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry she's missing it, sad, sad boy
Not my business, but I had to warn ya

Ooh, bet you're thinking, ""She's so cool""
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
Ooh, you've got me thinking, ""She's so cool""
But I know what I know and you're just another dude
Ooh, that's so true, ooh
[Bridge]
Made it out alive, but I think I lost it
Said that I was fine, said it from my coffin
Remember how I died when you started walking?
That's my life, that's my life
I'll put up a fight, taking out my earrings
Don't you know the vibe? Don't you know the feeling?
You should spend the night, catch me on your ceiling
That's your prize, that's your prize
Well

Mm, bet you're thinking, ""She's so cool""
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
