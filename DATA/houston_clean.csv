"[Letra de ""Loco""]
[Refrán]
Ey, cholo, yo no me equivoco
Si monto un reggaetón, ese culo lo reboto-boto
Ya préndela, güey, ya aquí traigo una de ley
Que lo poco que sé me lo enseñó el sensei
Ey, cholo, yo no me equivoco
Si monto un reggaetón, ese culo lo reboto-boto
Ya préndela, güey, ya aquí traigo una de ley
Que lo poco que sé me lo enseñó el sensei
[Verso]
Mamacita, nuevamente déjame probar un poco
Lе caigo de repentе, yo soy el que la sofoco
Mi suegra no me quiso, francamente, yo tampoco
A la doña le dijeron que andaba fumando fogo
Y aunque ya no somos nada, pero si quiere, la toco
Sale muy de zapatillas con su vestidito corto
Dicen que yo nunca cambio, que traigo los ojos rojos
Saco coche bomba y sale el humo por el quemacoco'
[Pre-Coro]
Y no, y no, no me digas que no
Si yo sé bien, sé bien que te gusto
Y no, y no, no me digas que no
Si yo sé bien, sé bien que te gusto
[Coro]
Me dijo tu amiga que tienes el cora roto
Desde que ando libre me la paso bien loco
Melday, no necesito tus polvo'
Me prestaron otros y otra vez ando bien coco
Me dijo tu amiga que tienes el cora roto
Desde que ando libre me la paso bien loco
Melday, no necesito tus polvo'
Me prestaron otros y otra vez ando bien coco
[Post-Coro]
Si me llamas, ya sabes que te robo
Como siempre, ya sabe' que estoy solo
Si me llama', ya sabes que te robo
Como siempre, ya sabe' que estoy solo

Turn it up a little more
[Verse 1: Gabito Ballesteros & 
Tito Double P
]
Seven days have passed, and it weighs on me that you're gone
That you won't come back, and in the end, to hell with it
It's just me and this fucking anxiety
This fucking anxiety
Thirty missed calls and a ""Where are you?""
How am I supposed to explain that I got lost in craziness?
The girls, the homies, to kill this anxiety?
Fucking anxiety
[Chorus: Gabito Ballesteros & 
Tito Double P
]
Tell me what's wrong with you
In the end, you don't even know what you want
To forget you, I made love with others
I don't even mind spending all this cash anymorе, watch out
Tell me what's wrong with you
We sworе love to each other forever
Stop pretending you don't love me
'Cause I can see in your eyes that you still do
Do you get it? Do you get it?
[Interlude: Tito Double P & 
Gabito Ballesteros
]
Hahaha
But do you get it or not?
Tito Double P, ay!
Ayo
That's how your buddy Gabito sounds, man
My little one
On his little motorcycle
Ooh!
[Verse 2: Gabito Ballesteros]
Seven days have passed, and now I accept that you're gone
That I'm gonna forget you and alcohol tastes bad
I already swore for my own good that I won't look at you again
I won't look at you again
[Chorus: Tito Double P & 
Gabito Ballesteros
]
Tell me what's wrong with you
In the end, you don't even know what you want
To forget you, I made love with others
I don't even mind spending all this cash anymore, watch out
Not even you understand yourself
Where did that forever love go?
Stop pretending you don't love me
'Cause I can see in your eyes that you do, understand that, understand that

Que a los ojos te miré
Y contarte las cosas que no te conté (Te parece' a mi crush, jaja)

Ey, hoy voy a estar con abuelo to'l día, jugando dominó
Si me pregunta si aún pienso en ti, yo le digo que no
Que mi estadía cerquita de ti ya se terminó
Ya se terminó, ey

When the Sun go down, everything make me feel lonely, yeah
I love side thing, but right now, he's just the homie
Tryna feel good inside, he never no wanna hold me
Hype me up, you get me hyped, you my favorite coach
Come press the line
Fucking stress off, that's my only vice
I take it off when he tell me if I'm feelin' fine
I run it up, risk it all like I'm rolling dice
Takin' it all, it's my second life
That's me (that's me)
Passed out in a nigga backseat (backseat)
Crashed out on a black-sand beach (uh)

You fuckin' with niggas that's thinkin' they cuter than you, oh
Say you on your cycle, but he on his period too, oh
The tables been turnin' so much, I was thinkin' it's foosball
The tenderness of 'em, mistakin' 'em for some wagyu, oh
Walk, talk like Kenny, like boss
Like Solána, I promise, more buzz, it's a wasp
It's a crater or a spaceship, shut the fuck up, get lost
No favors, I'll wager whatever you worth, I ball
Somethin' about a conservative, regular girl that still can beat a bitch ass
Thorough as fuck, don't need your bitch ass
Psychic as fuck, can read your bitch ass
Zodiac sign, it must be a Gemini Moon 'cause, shit, we about to go half
Mistakenly, nobody been in they bag, but how many bodies done been in her bed?

I can feel it
Girl, pick up your phone, I can't believe it
I can feel my spirit slowly leaving
I can't see myself and I'm not breathing (Ah)
I'm not breathing (I'm not breathing)
Slowly bleeding (Bleeding)
I wish that I told you all my feelings

I hope that I live life for a reason (Reason)
But at least you'll play this song
When I'm gone
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[Verse 2]
I can't see clear
I wash my fears with whisky tears
I disappear
Don't interfere, the end is near
The crowd'll scream
I block my ears to stop the cheers
'Cause the stage took a toll
Been faded on the floor
In this penthouse prison, I'm alone
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth (Hide the truth)
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah
[Bridge]
Every time I hit the road, it takes a little piece of me
Kills me slowly (Slowly)
When I needed you the most, you always gave me sympathy
Now you're over me (Over me)
Now you're better on your own, it ain't a fucking mystery
You've been showing me
Now I've been burning up my home, baby
I've been burning up my home
[Chorus]
And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah"

I don't want to be a Sapien no more
I just wanna be, ""Anna's Spalpeen"" (Oh, woah)
It can only mean a sad scene
Between me and you, we each other's vaccine
You like my caffeine
I cried over you behind the screen
If you were in a situation, I'd intervene and give a scene
Because I, I love you, make me serene

"Siento un vacío muy frío por dentro, mi amor
Cuando te fuiste, te robaste mi corazón
Me quedé loco de tanto pensar y pensar
Me iré al infierno, pero me tengo que vengar
Siento un vacío muy frío por dentro, mi amor
Cuando te fuiste, te robaste mi corazón
Me quedé loco de tanto pensar y pensar
Me iré al infierno, pero me tengo que vengar

Sé que el altar de Dios es santo, pero, mi amor
Cien invitados, y todos tendrán que mirar
Que nuestro amor va al más allá
Quiero que bailemos juntos
En el cielo, el infierno, pero sin ese puto
El que te ha apartado todo este tiempo de mí
Al inconsciente que hizo que no fueras pa mí
Danza, una danza eterna
Pero me voy contigo, pero no vamos juntos
Llevo tres noches malditas sin poder dormir
Solo pensando y pensando que eres para mí, pa mí
¡Uh!
Me despido de ti para siempre, chiquitita
Ahí le va pa todos los que traen el corazón roto
¡Uh!
Y su compa Oscar Maydon
Y Fuerza Regida
Camino lento, me duele la respiración
A mil por hora, latidos de mi corazón
En el pasillo me vienen recuerdos, flashbacks
Prometimos que los dos iríamos al altar
Te quitó el velo, aceptaste y luego te besó
Ya has consumado los votos sagrados, mi amor
Un frío muy intenso se llevó todo mi ser
Ya no hay razón pa estar de pie
Quiero que bailemos juntos
En el cielo, el infierno, pero sin ese puto
Al que te ha apartado todo este tiempo de mí
Al inconsciente que hizo que no fueras pa mí
Danza, una danza eterna
Pero me voy contigo, pero no vamos juntos
Llevo tres noches malditas sin poder dormir
Solo pensando y pensando que eras para mí
Miro cómo brillan tus ojos
Me resigno a perderte, y esta vez para siempre
Me arrepentí de quitarte tu felicidad
Te dejaré, una familia puedas comenzar
Me despido, me despido pa siempre
Y te deseo suerte y bendigo mi muerte

A la persona que roto tiene el corazón"

Moving one toe was the only form of motion left

Said you didn't look good
That you barely finished the show
I just hope you're not back to the old you
How much longer you in Texas for?

Don't let them take you from me

45 off a safe
At the top is my place
You and I, different wave
Always know when you're late
I could never tell you wait
Made me talk at the lake
Lavish life type of estate
Losin' time when you pace
What we can do if you'd waste?
I know the skies been in haze
You never been through this phase
Been in fire, livin' fake
Know you try, but it's late
I run the lobby, every summer
Buy her body, two-step a stutter
Platinum 'round my wrist, bird chirp like I'm stunna
Look around this bitch while the DJ set cut up
Flashes from the pics in my sections while I'm fucked up
Bad bitch, I been waitin' to get with, hope I don't nut up
Yeah, nut up, man, this shit is trouble
I been hittin' licks, seein' splits, doin' double
No, it's no events, check my temp, watch it bubble

Don't you let me down
If you let me drown
Die in your arms again
I won't make a sound
Blood on the ground
When they take my crown
If they take my crown

What does that shit feel like anyway?"

All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July

[Verse 1]
2 a.m. and I'm live
I just left out the club with the gang and a hot yellow bitch that's real thick in the thighs
You know me, I be shootin' my shot
When I got the lil' bitch, I wasn't even surprised
In the club, looked her deep in her eyes
Said, ""You comin' with me, if you with it, let's ride""
Got a text, ""When you comin' inside?""
Off the liquor, didn't know what to say, so I lied
I text back like, ""I'm late at thе stu' tryna cook somethin' new, it's just me and thе guys""
She text, ""Hmm,"" I ain't even reply
Then I rolled up a 'Wood while I gripped on her thighs
Started to kiss on her neck, know this bitch feelin' high
Ain't gon' lie, shit, her pussy and head kinda fie
Ended at hotel somewhere off 35
Fucked her good and rolled over, said, ""Wake me in five""
Gotta piss, I wake up, man, it's 6:39
Outta time, now I'm on the highway and I'm flyin'
Look at my phones, not a soul on my line
Now I'm deep in my thoughts, I'm just knowin' she cryin'
I'm trippin', I'm tryna straight out all the lies
'Cause I know if I slip, it's gon' damage our ties
I done did it before, I can't do all this cryin'
[Chorus]
It's 2 a.m., I'm just getting in, about to check my message
No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors
Cellular rings, somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her, she don't hit me back, something is funny
 (Ayy)

She gon' ask where I was, I'ma answer, ""What time?""
""Where was you around 3?"" ""I think I was outside""
""But you told me the stu'?"" ""We got through at like 5""
""But it's 7,"" ""Shit, Dion had asked for a ride""
Now I got it together, I pull up outside
It's three cars in this lot and one of 'em ain't mine
Now I'm clutchin', I unlock the door, creep inside
I hear thumpin' upstairs, so I cock the bitch quiet
Hit the top of the stairs, think I hear my girl cryin'
Now I'm thinkin', ""Should I kick the door and kill everything in it except for what's mine?""
I don't know, but now I'm at the door
And she screamin', ""Go deeper,"" he tell her, ""Be quiet""
I walk in, tell the bitch that she wild
Tell the nigga he move, then it's 'bout to go down
Tell 'em both to shut up and don't even make a sound
She say, ""But,"" I say, ""Shut the fuck up and lay down""
Next person move, I'ma let off a round
Now I'm pacin', I'm tryna see how I'm gettin' down
If I kill 'em both, then that make me a clown
Mama told me don't trust 'em, but look at me now
One in the chamber, two faced on the ground
Got me like, ""Should I leave or just burn this bitch down?""
I wake up, it's a dream, I'm outside of my house

It's 2 a.m., I'm just getting in, about to check my message

Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor
[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
[Verse 2]
You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate,
 
tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie,
 
he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
[Chorus]
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
[Verse 3]
Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar
[Bridge]
Mm
Mm-mm
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)
He a fan, he a fan, he a
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Let me hear you say, ""OV-ho"" (
OV-ho
)
Say, ""OV-ho"" (
OV-ho
)
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way
[Outro]
Are you my friend?
Are we locked in?
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way"
"[Chorus]
Only thing that's saving you (Oh-oh)
Is the heart of a woman
Yeah
Only thing that's saving you
Is the heart of a woman
Hey, yeah
[Verse 1]
Question is why I do the things I do?
Answer I may never find, but I'll always choose you
Wanna give up on you, but, damn, I know I can't
I put the blame on me for giving you chance after chance
[Pre-Chorus]
In love with you, but can't stand your ways
And I try to be strong
But how much can I take?
Put your words on your life this time
And I hope your ass ain't lyin' 'cause
[Chorus]
Only thing that's saving you (Only thing that's saving you)
Is the heart of a woman (Woman)
Yeah, oh yeah
Only thing that's saving you (Saving you)
Is the heart of a woman
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
It's my mind and my soul versus your pride
Nigga, check your ego 'cause I left mine at thе door
Just because I let it slidе
Drowning in all my emotions, I'll let you slide in this ocean, I'm in
[Pre-Chorus]
In love with you, but can't stand your ways
And I try to be strong
But how much can I take?
Put your words on your life this time (Your life)
And I hope your ass ain't lyin' 'cause
[Chorus]
Only thing that's saving you (No, I can't take it no more)
(l'm 'bout to walk out the door) Is the heart of a woman
Oh, oh
Only thing that's saving you (Saving you)
Is the heart of a woman (Ah-ah)"
"[Intro]
DaVinci (DaVi
nci, DaVinci)
Yeah
Shoutout the whole Oakland City, man
You know what I'm saying? The whole 4PF
Know what I'm saying? I put this up
Yeah
[Verse]
Shoutout my label, that's me
I'm in this bitch with TB
I'm in this bitch with 4 Trey
I just poured up me an eight
Real nigga all in my face
Five hundred racks in my safe
Five hundred racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love?
What you know 'bout pullin' up in Bentley trucks?
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no ho
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom, we used to wear each other's clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain't my niggas no more
Hold it down for the four
In the nine with the woes
Marlo my dawg, that's for sure
We won't fall out about shit
'Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain't gon' fall out 'bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both of my ears on froze
I been gettin' faded, I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck, I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties, I pay for 'em
Get outta that when I wake up
I pass the ball, I don't layup
I'm a big boss, I got say so
They'll wipe you down if I say so
Dracos on Dracos on Dracos on Dracos
40s on 40s on 40s
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina, shoutout New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint, change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz truck
Hop out fresher than a menthol
Lil' nigga, but I'm big, dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Get a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talkin' 'bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones, don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer, don't push me
I see how you niggas be lurkin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a Vert with an Uzi
12 get behind me, I lose 'em
They tryna guess what I'm doin'
They tryna guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits
[Outro]
Yeah"
